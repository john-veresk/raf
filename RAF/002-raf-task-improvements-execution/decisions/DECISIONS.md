# Project Decisions

## For Task 1 (Show Model at Task Start): The original plan mentions detecting the model from Claude CLI. Do you have a specific method in mind?
Task is already in progress - implementation exists in uncommitted source files. Uses `getClaudeModel()` which reads from `~/.claude/settings.json`.

## Task 1 (Show Model) is already implemented. Should this project just commit it?
Include task to commit the existing uncommitted changes for Task 007.

## For Task 2 (Move State/Logs to .raf/): Should we migrate existing state?
Skip this task entirely - user wants to get rid of .raf completely in the future.

## What should we do with the 008-move-state-logs-to-project.md plan file?
Delete it - the task won't be implemented.
