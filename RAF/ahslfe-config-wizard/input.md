- [ ] introduce config. go through the codebase and come up with config structure, ask me if something needs to be configured or not. also introduce "raf config [prompt]" that will take prompt and uses sonnet to make changes in raf config. make it json. store config in ~/.raf. create a .md doc with documentation and use it in instructions for "raf config [prompt or no prompt]" to start interactive session with claude (sonnet) to update config (claude will have appended system prompt with all the knowledge about config and how and where to change it). put in config stuff like reasoning, model choice per scenario (plan, do, project name generation etc.), worktree or not worktree by default, put there max setting you find in the repo (like commit format)
