- [ ] **Accumulate token usage across retry attempts** When a task retries, this assignment overwrites prior `usageData`, and the tracker is only updated once after the retry loop, so tokens/cost from earlier failed attempts are dropped. In any task that takes multiple attempts, the per-task and total summaries underreport actual consumption, which skews cost reporting for long or flaky runs.
