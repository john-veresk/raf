## Status: SUCCESS

# Task 005 - Completed

Let me verify all acceptance criteria are met:
1. ✅ **CLAUDE.md reflects new outcome format** - Updated the "State Derivation Over Persistence" section to use `<promise>COMPLETE</promise>` / `<promise>FAILED</promise>` markers
2. ✅ **Status marker documentation updated** - Changed from `## Status: SUCCESS/FAILED` to the new `<promise>` format
3. ✅ **Failure analysis documented** - Added new "Failure Analysis" section covering Haiku analysis, programmatic failures, and report structure
4. ✅ **No stale references to old format** - CLAUDE.md is the main documentation file and it's been updated. The old outcomes and plan files are historical records, not active documentation.
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
