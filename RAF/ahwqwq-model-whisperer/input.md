- [ ] show actual execution model per task (on the task line in perentesis, like (sonnet) or
  (opus). not only in verbose mode
- [ ] use claude $ estimation instead of own calculations for token usage report
- [ ] i don't see session limit estimates in token report (**showRateLimitEstimate**). investigate
  and create task if needed (remove functionlity entirely)
